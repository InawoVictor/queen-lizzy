                                Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, 
                                London, as the first child of the Duke & Duchess of York 
                                (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). Her father acceded to the 
                                throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, making 
                                Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to 
                                undertake public duties during the Second World War,
                                serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service.s

                                In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, 
                                a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 
                                73 years until his death in April 2021. They had four children: Charles III; 
                                Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. 
                                Elizabeth II was Queen of the United Kingdom from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. 
                                Her reign of 70 years and 214 days was the longest of any 
                                British monarch and the second-longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country. 
                                At the time of her death, 
                                Elizabeth was also Queen of 14 other Commonwealth realms in addition to the United Kingdom.
